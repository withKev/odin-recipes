    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta
      carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ingredients are simple—just spaghetti (or another long pasta), and the
      carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan, a little olive
      oil, salt and pepper. The silky carbonara sauce is created when the beaten
      eggs are tossed with the hot pasta and a little fat from the pancetta or
      bacon.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g spaghetti</li>
      <li>6 egg yolks</li>
      <li>150 g guanciale</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>50 g pecorino cheese</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large serving bowl, whisk together
        <strong>egg yolks, a few grinds of black pepper, and cheese</strong>.
        Bring large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and
        cook until al dente, approx. 7 – 9 min., or according to package
        instructions. Reserve about 120 ml/ 1/2 cup pasta water before draining
        and setting aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry diced guanciale until it's crisp and the fat has rendered. Add
        peeled and crushed garlic, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pasta to frying pan and toss until coated with the fat, then remove
        the pan from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer pasta from the frying pan along with half of the reserved pasta
        water to a serving bowl with the egg mixture, mixing everything together
        quickly so that the eggs don’t scramble. Toss until the mixture turns
        creamy and thick, adding more pasta water as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season to taste with salt and black pepper and serve garnished with more
        cheese. Enjoy!
